## Windows

## pubspec.yaml

On Windows, you will need to add a custom version of `native_toolchain_c` to your `dependency_overrides`. This is currently needed to link static libraries when building a DLL.

```
native_toolchain_c:
    git:
      url: git@github.com:nmfisher/native.git
      path: pkgs/native_toolchain_c
      ref: 99020084c4687be4c58c7115a167088c0441d1de
```

This will eventually be fixed upstream in the `native_toolchain_c` package, so this should be a short-term/temporary issue only.

## ANGLE build (not currently working)
To support embedding GPU textures in Flutter (rather than copying to a CPU pixel buffer on every frame), we need to build a slightly customized version of Filament that uses GLES on Windows (rather than the default, which uses OpenGL).

```
git checkout flutter-filament-windows
mkdir out && cd out
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe" --build . --target gltf_viewer --config Debug
```
